# odin-recipes
Created for The Odin Project foundation lesson - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

Objectives:
Create a website that will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. Style is not the focus and will be revisited in the future once CSS is learned.
