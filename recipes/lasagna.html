    <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>
    <p><em>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and 
        a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta 
        but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found 
        none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li> 
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <p><b>Step 1</b></p>
    <p>Gather all Ingredients</p>
    <p><b>Step 2</b></p>
    <p>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned 
        and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. </p>
    <p><b>Step 3</b></p>
    <p>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes</p>
    <p><b>Step 4</b></p>
    <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsely, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar.        
     Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</p>
     <p><b>Step 5</b></p>
    <p>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in 
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and 
        set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </p>
    <p><b>Step 6</b></p>
    <p>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a 
        large bowl until combined. </p>
    <p><b>Step 7</b></p>
    <p>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. 
        Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. </p>
    <p><b>Step 8</b></p>
    <p>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat 
        layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish 
        with aluminum foil. </p>
    <p><b>Step 9</b></p>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 
        more minutes. </p>
    <p><b>Step 10</b></p>
    <p>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p>

    <h3>Recipe Tip</h3>
    <p>For a more traditional filling, substitute ricotta cheese for cottage cheese. You can also add layers of
        veggies, such as spinach and mushrooms, when layering your lasagna.
